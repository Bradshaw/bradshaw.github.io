Nanoleptic is a collective of digital game creators and digital artists. We are [Gaeel](gaeel), [Wilbefast](wilbefast), [Jimmy W. Seid](jimmy) and [Shapter](shapter).   

Jimmy and Shapter are currently working on a fast-paced, demon-fueled strategy game designed to be played with friends from the comfort of a couch. It's coming soon and you can find out more [here](http://soulharvestgame.com/)!   

Gaeel is doing a lot of writing these days, he's pretty proud of [this article](https://medium.com/@_Gaeel_/what-keyboards-taught-me-about-people-d3f1badd161b) about two of his passions: custom computers keyboard and interesting people.
